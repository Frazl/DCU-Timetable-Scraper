```

### Functions

### run

#### Description

Run is the main function of this program.

Run returns either two things, a dictionary or a list(if no time specified).

If run returns a dictionary the keys are the times. 
````
(times.keys()) 
````

If run returns a list, a time has been given and the list will contain the possible modules on at that time. *Note that more than one module can be on at once with optional modules for courses and week dependent modules.*

e.g. Return for a list 

```
run("Thu","11:00", "CA", "1")

['Digital Innovation Management and Enterprise In GLA.L125, GLA.L128 With Ward M', 'Digital Innovation Management and Enterprise In GLA.QG15 With ANOTHER for MW']
```

#### Usage

```
run(day, time, code, year)
````
day: ["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"]

time (optional): 24hr format only takes the hour or half hour currently. 

e.g 17:00 and 14:30 but *not 14:31*

code (optional): Module code, e.g. CA = Computer Applications, AF = Accounting Finance 

Year(optional): The year code for the module, e.g. 1,2,3,4 (Must be in string format)

*Note: code defaults to CA if none entered and year defaults to 1*

### next

#### Description

Next runs run(day, time, code) with the current time and day and can return two things similiar to run.

If it is past 5:30PM next will return the timetable for tomorrow in the form of a dictionary with keys time.keys()

If it is before 5:30pm it will return a list of what is due to be on in the next hour. 

e.g. If it is currently 10AM it will see what is on at 11AM and send that back. 

#### Usage

```
next(code, year)
```

code(optional): Module code, e.g. CA = Computer Applications, AF = Accounting Finance

year(optional): The year code for the module, e.g. 1,2,3,4 (Must be in string format) 

*Note: code defaults to CA if none entered and year defaults to 1*


### beautify

#### Description

Beautify takes data i.e a list or dictionary and prints it out nicely. 

The main function of this is for testing and for standalone functionality.

e.g. beautify(run("Mon","11:00","AF", "1")) *More examples can be seen in the main() function // Run bs4dcu.py*

#### Usage 

```
beautify(datacontent)
```

datacontent: A list or dictionary - * Dictionary must be using keys times.keys() *

### responsehandler

#### Description

Takes in a list and returns neatly formatted text in the form of a string

### dictionaryhandler
